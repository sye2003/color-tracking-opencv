# Color Tracking with OpenCV

This project uses OpenCV and Python to detect and track a specific color (e.g., yellow) in real-time using your webcam.

## Features

- Detects color using HSV color space for better accuracy
- Displays a mask highlighting the detected color area
- Can be extended for object tracking and robotics applications

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pillow

Install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
